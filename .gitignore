#### **Step 2: Jettison the Unnecessary Cargo**

Now that the shield is in place, we must remove the `node_modules` folders that you have already mistakenly staged for transmission.

1.  Make sure your terminal is still at the **root** of your project.
2.  Execute this critical command. It will remove all staged files and then re-stage them, but this time it will obey the new `.gitignore` rules.

    ```bash
    git rm -r --cached .
    ```
    * `git rm -r --cached .`: This command tells Git, "Remove everything from the current staging area, but do not delete the actual files from my computer."

3.  After the command finishes, stage everything again. This time, only your actual code will be included.

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

#### **Step 3: Re-issue the Transmission**

Now that the cargo hold contains only essential schematics, we will re-commit and re-transmit.

1.  Create a new commit. The message can be simple, as it's a corrective action.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "chore: Configure .gitignore and remove node_modules"
    ```

2.  Initiate the final transmission.

    ```bash
    git push
